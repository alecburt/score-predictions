### score-predictions

This is my score prediction league I use for my football group Amarillo Army.

Rules are simple:
Each player predicts the result, the score and an anytime goals scorer and recieves between 0-5 pts.
Each game week I need to create a table to show all the results calculated

Written in python with a TKinter gui.
